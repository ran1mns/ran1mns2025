Résumé ultra détaillé d'un matin weekend (preterit) :

On last Saturday morning, I woke up at 7.30am.
It was after a very good night and just after an hour listening to music. On weekends, I like waking up slowly with classical music!
I chose to listen to France Musique because it's a public radio and there's no advertising.

I took my clothes and went to the bathroom. Like every morning, I had to pee… Then I had a shower.
The soap I used was a special one, with no dirty components like paraben or other ones.
I dried myself with a brand new lavender-smelling towel!
I dressed myself and went to the kitchen to prepare my breakfast.
My coffee is Maxhavelaard labeled. I try to do things ethically!

I put the coffee beans in the blender, added a spoon of chicoree, and poured the mixed coffee into my Italian coffee maker.
I took some bread slices and put some marmalade on them.
With a glass of water, I ate my marmaladed bread! I drank my coffee, cleaned the table and washed the dishes.

I wrote a list and drove to the supermarket to buy some groceries.
I bought some cheese, chose a new carpet for my kitchen, took beers of course, and many other things!
The highway was congested so I arrived home at 10 am.
I put what I bought in the right place.
I prepared another coffee and had a break watching TV.
I watched a documentary about the Solar Temple Order.
It ended just before the time to prepare lunch.

    <h2>Anecdote embarrassante</h2>
    <pre>
I used to buy my beers at a Turkish grocery on the corner of my street.
Every day, a man, who looked old to me, gave me my beers and took my money.
One day, I didn't have enough money (20 cents), so he said it's ok and invited me to come back the next morning with the money.
The next day, he wasn't there. A wife welcomed me and asked, "What do you need today?"
I ordered a beer and mentioned I needed to pay more because the boss let me go the previous day without paying.
She looked at me strangely and asked: "The boss, who?"
I was embarrassed and said: "You know, the man who was here yesterday, maybe your grandfather…"
She replied, "He's my husband."
